    "Unless you are a computer science major, binary representation is not a thing you learn when you start programming in Python, however, anyone with a mathematical/physics eye will recognize this is the study of Sequence and Series. Therefore, let's cover some general principles and methods for solving problems. Side note, this is really ancient knowledge about the concept of numbers in base 2, base 10, base 6, base 12, base 60, ect., ect..\n",
